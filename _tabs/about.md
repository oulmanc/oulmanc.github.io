Hello to you my friend! My name is Carlos Oulman. I grew up in St. Anthony Park, a small neighborhood in northwest St. Paul, Minnesota. After completing sixth grade at Adams’s Spanish Immersion School, I relocated with my family to the small town of Clear Lake, Iowa in 2007. I then attend Clear Lake Middle School and would go on to graduate from Clear Lake High School in 2012.

It was while I was at Adam’s that my first passion for technology started. Getting a chance to visit the computer lab was always something I looked forward to. While attending middle school, I had my first experience with computers attached to a Windows domain. I was fascinated with the fact that I could log on to any computer with the same username and password. Also in middle school, I started to get interested in web design. I built my first website for a class project and from there, I started expanding on what I could do.

My first websites were built using drag and drop editors but after a few years, I needed the ability to do more than these platforms could offer. I started learning HTML and CSS and built a website from scratch. I would then later discover Joomla and learned the power behind content management systems. After exploring what I could do with Joomla, I switched to WordPress and have been using it ever since.

Throughout high school, I started to become more and more interested in managing Windows domains and even installed Windows Server 2008 on an old computer I had sitting around. I connected all the computers in my home to the domain and created logins for family and friends.

In 2017, I was approached about creating a way for disabled parishioners at a local church to view the weekly services while the church was being renovated and the elevator would be out of service for about eight months. With the help of a few others, I coordinated and built a full live stream solution complete with a webcam and audio feed directly from the church sound system. This initial project grew into much more as I continued to assist with the IT needs of the church and it would eventually help me get my first IT job.
